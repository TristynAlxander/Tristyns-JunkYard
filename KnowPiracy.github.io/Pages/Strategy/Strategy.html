<p>
There are two parts to getting what you want: discouragement and encouragement.
One has to make choices to create a system that discourages some options and encourages others. 
Once you know what you want this becomes simple.
</p>
<br>
<h2 class="B">Discouragement</h2>
<p>
Here we discourage negative options by pressuring the current economic system with piracy.
This means people need to get good at piracy. Specifically, piracy needs best-practices and diversification. 
Best practices ought include a lot, but most especially ways to learn how to pirate.
Most pirated material is media. Academic and Physicals are lacking. 
</p>
<br>
<h2 class="B">Encouragement</h2>
<p>
Here we encourage positive options by presenting economic and legal options. 
Economic options are more important, like much more important. 
Systems from crowd funding to tax-credits need to be presented and supported.
Legal options are less important, but there are plenty of them in these: Constitutions IP Clause, First Amendment's Free Speech, UN's Human Rights, Political Pirate Parties, Religious Kopimism.
