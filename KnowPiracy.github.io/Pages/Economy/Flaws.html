<h1 class="MainSubTitle">Mini-page: Intellectual Property Flaws</h1>

<h2 class="B" title="Kinda" id="Own">Can one own ideas?</h2>
<p>
Our society has made ideas<text title="Technically, the mediums... not that mediums are an at all significant part of communication...">*</text> ownable, and equated IP-infringement to theft, but the system doesn't really work. 
Ideas have no clear boundary or <a href="../Ethics/Ethics#Origin">origin</a>. 
So, it's not that one can't lay or enforce claims. It's that one can't do so consistently. 
</p>

<h2 class="B">Legal Trolls</h2>
<p>
Legal Trolls use suing or the threat of suing to make a profit. 
This is not a problem isolated to intellectual property.
However, the cost of defence is excessive, and this discourages entrepreneurship. 
</p>

<h2 class="B">Monopolies</h2>
<p>
Intellectual-property grants the exclusive right to reproduce and (consequently) to profit from a work to authors. 
This is a legal monopoly, which not only discourages but eliminates competition for a work.
