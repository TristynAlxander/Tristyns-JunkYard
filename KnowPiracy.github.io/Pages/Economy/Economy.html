<b>Intellectual-Property-Infringement</b> is a black market, which merely means goods/services are illegally traded. 
It was created to offset the cost-of-creation and <text title="Note: The U.S. Constitution was not the origin of IP.">(arguably)</text> incentivize creation, and has sense <text title="Wrecked competition.">grown out-of-hand</text>. 
Intellectual-Property operates by allocating exclusive rights to creators for <del>limited</del> durations and scopes. 
A core problem is the original origin of concepts, essentially: <text title="Everything's a Remix.">Who's the <i>True/Real</i> creator</title>?
Intellectual-Property is not the only, much less the best, option. 
Creator's Tax Credits could refund (even incentivize) by crediting creators back for their losses, and concepts would then remain in the public domain. 
A core problem here is the standard for reimbursement, essentially: <text title="Public's Consumption, Documentation amongst Professionals, ???">What dictates proof, and how much is needed</text>?

Intellectual-Property-Infringement is a market force that encourages changing the way we deal with creation costs (and incentivization). 
Just as the current system is justified by the <a href="Cruelty.html">cruelty of the brutal system</a>. 
Intellectual-Property-Infringement's justification is in the <a href="Flaws.html">flaws of the current system</a>. 
Whether either of these justifications is sufficient remains at debate, but the necessity for change is clear. 
<a href="New.html">We need a new method.</a>

<b>Cargo theft</b> is usually harder to make an economic justification for. 
Maybe the prey's hoarding resources? Maybe it's for sake of bare bones survival?
Maybe the prey stole it themselves? Maybe you're a mercenary who's not actually interested in a justification? 
Making a profit justification be damned, has been the conclusion of pirates' and businessmens' greed many times.
That's usually a bit thoughtless. After all, there are some things money can't buy, unless you have a lot of it. 
</p><p>
Pirates have also been known to do quite a lot of smuggling. 
After all, what's the point of stealing expensive things if you can't sell them? 
Justifying smuggling usually connects back to what you're smuggling. 
In similarity to predator-pirates, many smugglers aren't particularly concerned with economic justifications of their trade. 
</p><p>
Pirates, especially romanticized pirates, can have legitimate professions too. 
Such jobs can range from treasure hunting and salvage to security and entertainment.
These aren't generally considered to need justification; however, encouraging the theme within these industries with tax breaks or free publicity would be awesome.

I lack data supporting my positions. 
The problem is finding quality unbiased data. 
Some data appeals to the money some data appeals to the masses. 
I've seen studies supporting a diverse range of opinions, but I've chosen to cite none. 
One should always trust the data. If you find reliable sources, form your opinions from the data they present.
