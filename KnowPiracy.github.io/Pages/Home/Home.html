<h2 class="B">Parody Status</h2>
<p>
This site is a parody of <text title="Anti- Intellectual-Property Infringement">anti-piracy</text> organizations. 
Namely, this site is a mockery of  <a href="http://NoPiracy.org" target="_blank">NoPiracy.org</a>.
Anti-piracy organizations have consistently gone to extremes, and as such so must this site.
Consequently, here you'll find support for all sorts of piracy; however, in caution of their extremism <i>Know Piracy</i> is all talk. 
There's no ship, no cannons, and certainly no IP-infringement.
</p><p>
Furthermore, <i>Know Piracy</i> is in the fortunate position of mocking a position that is both far reaching and absurd.
As such the site's own extremism can take a stark and obvious contrast to genuine suggestions for progress. 
Alternatively, if one can't or chooses not to distinguish this contrast, we welcome the advent of more piratey culture. Arg.

<h2 class="B">What's a Pirate?</h2>
<p>
Technically, a pirate is one who commits piracy: Criminal, non-wartime robbery at sea. 
They're are usually distinguished from smugglers and mercenaries; however, they can be closely tied in business. 
Beyond technicality, pirates have been romanticized into their own loosely defined theme. 
Key components of the theme include: freedom, greed, and adventure. The <a href="../Culture/Culture.html">Culture</a> tab addresses the theme in depth. 
</p><p>
In terms of Intellectual-Property, Pirates are still those who commit piracy; however, piracy gets redefined as IP-infringement.
The argument goes that IP-infringement is theft, piracy is theft, and therefore IP-infringement is piracy.
Not entirely sure what happened to the sea there, but we'll let it slide. 
The more persistent question seems to be: <a href="../Economy/Flaws.html#Own" title="Kinda.">Is IP-infringement theft?</a>
</p>
<br>
<h2 class="B">Why care?</h2>
<p>
Often people forget that there are an exceptional number of reasons not to care.
It's neither inconceivable nor deplorable to dismiss the discussion out-of-hand. 
After all, encouraging an entire thematic bias for a society is a bit extreme. 
No matter how cool pirates are.  
</p><p>
The apathy can stand in the intellectual property argument as well because the system shouldn't affect anyone. 
It currently benefits some, punishes some, and irritates the hell out the others; but there are still people who can get away with ignoring it all together. 
That said, if it is in the way of some of your ambitions, you have a clear prerogative to reform the system. 
Intellectual property is a significant part of the current system, and it may be a part you need to reform.
