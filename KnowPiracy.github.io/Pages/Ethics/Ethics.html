<h2 class="B" id="Origin">Unique, but Unoriginal</h2>
<p>
Often times the term original gets used colloquially to mean unique; however, they have distinctly different meanings. 
Originality refers to the origins of a work while uniqueness refers to its one-of-a-kind nature.
Originality is a myth. There are no original works. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9ryPC8bxqE" target="_blank">Everything's a Remix</a>.
Likewise, uniqueness is common place: there's no such thing as a special snowflake. 
At best there are non-generic works, but they're not effectively original. 
They still owe a debt to their origins.
</p><p>
In STEM fields building on one's predecessors is accepted and understood: 
You study, study, study, then combine and build on the scientific facts you know. 
The same is true of creative fields; though, they'd be reluctant to admit it. 
You study generas, tropes, cliches, themes, and other artistic methods.
Then, you build on the accumulation of culture before you. 
</p><p>
There's no shame in being (non-colloquially) unoriginal. 
What's rubbish is genericism: The gradual destruction of culture through repetition of non-coherent and uncritical garbage. 
Everything uses sources, but not everything has to be the same. 
Combining diverse artistic methods with interesting &ndash; even if unoriginal &ndash; ideas can lead to a rich culture with quality works.

<h3 class="B">Freedoms</h3><p>
Intellectual property prevents alternative economic choices. Choices are kinda very important to freedom. 
Additionally, it discourages derivative forms of speech via <text title="Censorship doesn't have to be political.">&copy;ensorship</text>. 
It also puts a clear economic gradient on information access, which should probably be a common good rather than a luxury.

<ul>
<li><q cite="Zacqary Adam Xeper">If free and open access to all of human knowledge at the push of a button truly prevents our society's beloved artists, authors, thinkers, and other creative people from putting food on their tables, then maybe it's time to rethink how to put food on their tables.</q> &nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash; Zacqary Adam Xeper</li>
<li><q cite="Nina Paley">Copying is not theft, but censorship is. When a video is blocked, banned, erased, or otherwise censored, we don't have it any more.</q> &nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash; Nina Paley</li>
<li><q cite="John Green">Like, I do not believe that an author has a privileged relationship with a story simply because s/he happens to have written it.</q><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash; John Green, in regards to intellectual value (not IP).</li>
